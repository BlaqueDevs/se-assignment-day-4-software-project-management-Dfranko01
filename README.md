## ANSWERS:
1. Timely delivery is crucial in software project management because it ensures that the project stays within budget, meets client expectations, and aligns with market opportunities. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by setting realistic timelines, monitoring progress, and managing resources effectively.

2. Effective cost control helps prevent budget overruns and ensures that the project remains financially viable. Strategies include regular budget monitoring, using cost estimation tools, and maintaining a clear project scope to avoid scope creep.

3. Agile is flexible, allows for iterative development, and adapts to changes quickly, making it ideal for projects with evolving requirements. Waterfall is linear and structured, suitable for projects with well-defined requirements. Agile’s main disadvantage is potential scope creep, while Waterfall’s rigidity can lead to delayed feedback and adjustments.

4. Agile is beneficial for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements, such as software startups or app development. Waterfall suits projects with well-defined requirements, like government contracts or construction software. Example: Agile for a mobile app, Waterfall for a banking system upgrade.

5. Methods for ensuring quality assurance include code reviews, automated testing, continuous integration, and user acceptance testing. Maintaining high standards is crucial to avoid bugs, ensure user satisfaction, and meet regulatory requirements.

6. Defining the project scope ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what will be delivered, reducing the risk of scope creep. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a tool that breaks down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, making planning and tracking easier.

7. Developing a detailed project schedule helps manage time effectively, allocate resources, and monitor progress. Gantt charts assist by visually representing the timeline of tasks, dependencies, and milestones, making it easier to track and adjust schedules.

8. Core issues the software aims to address are inefficiencies, user dissatisfaction, or market gaps. These problems are significant because they directly impact the user experience, productivity, and competitiveness of the target audience.

9. Clearly defining the problem helps in developing a targeted solution, ensuring that the software addresses the most critical needs of the users and provides maximum value.

10. The software solution is a user-friendly platform designed to streamline tasks, improve productivity, and enhance user experience, catering specifically to the needs of [target audience].

11. The main features that make the software stand out include intuitive design, real-time collaboration, robust security, and seamless integration with existing tools.

12. Market data shows a growing demand for [industry-specific] solutions, with a market size of $X billion and an annual growth rate of X%, indicating significant potential for the software.

13. Understanding market trends helps position the software to meet current and future demands, ensuring that the development is aligned with user expectations and industry standards.
